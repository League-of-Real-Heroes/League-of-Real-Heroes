###League of Real Heroes (Multi Player Open Source Action-RTS)
Itâ€™s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse Open Source GameDev Community of Real Heroes around the world.

LoR Heroes is a 2014 multiplayer online battle arena video game,inspired by the mod Defense of the Ancients and League of Legends.
It is a free-to-play game, supported by Gamerscoin.

In League of Real Heroes, players assume the role of a character, called a "champion", with unique abilities, battling with a team against other player or computer-controlled champions. In the most popular game modes, each team's goal is to destroy the opposing team's Base, a building which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures. Each League of Real Heroes game is discrete, with all champions starting off each game fairly weak and progressing by accumulating gold and experience over the course of the game.

###Gameplay :
League of Real Heroes is a multiplayer online battle arena where players control a "champion" within short PvP or bot battles.
Different champions, all of which are classified by type (such as assassin, tank, or support), which indicates the champion's gameplay style.
Players gain levels from killing the opposing team's champions, controlled by other players or bots, and minions that regularly spawn and attack the other team's turrets, minions, and champions. In the classic game mode, the map is typically divided into three "lanes", which are paths that spawned minions take; the "jungle", an area between lanes where neutral monsters spawn; and "bases", where players spawn and can purchase items.

The three lanes are composed of the bottom, mid, and top lanes, which different champions tend to battle on based on their respective types. The jungle is sometimes considered a lane, where some champion tends to roam in order to collect buffs and assist in the other lanes freely. The player earns a small amount of gold every second passively, but can earn more by getting the last hit on minions, destroying enemy towers (referred to as turrets) that guard the lanes, killing neutral monsters located in the jungle, and killing enemy champions. With this gold, users can buy a variety of items to strengthen their champion for the remaining duration of the game.

The player is identified as a "summoner" and acts as the persistent element in the game. A summoner's statistics and scores are tracked and are accessible to the player.Summoners gain experience points and Influence Gold for each battle they participate in. Experience points lead to persistent level gains for the summoner, up to a maximum level of 150.

###Game modes and matchmaking :
League of Real Heroes is a session-based game. Matchmaking creates teams with even average Matchmaking Rating (MMR) of the constituent players. MMR uses the Elo formula with proprietary adjustments.

Custom mode allows players to create games that players manually join rather than relying on the game's matchmaking system to create the teams. In custom matches, the teams can be uneven and may include a mix of players and bots (computer-controlled champions).

Classic mode is a normal or ranked match in which a team wins by destroying the enemy team's Base, which can only be attacked if all lane turrets and the inhibitor in at least one lane and all base turrets are destroyed.

Classic mode is played in two different styles: either 5 vs. 5 on a three-lane map, each team's side having three lane turrets and an inhibitor per lane, as well as two base turrets and a Base; or 3 vs. 3 on a two-lane map, each team's side having two lane turrets and an inhibitor per lane, as well as one base turret and a Base. The map also has three altars, two of which add bonuses to the players, and one that heals the players. These altars are surrounded by a jungle.

Normal matches are player versus player. Before the beginning of the match, there are several ways for team players to select their champions. Blind pick matches allow both teams to pick champions at the same time, but each team does not learn what the opposing team has picked until all picks have been finalized; players may therefore incidentally choose the same champion as a player on the opposing team, but players may not choose the same champion as another player on their own team. Draft pick randomly assigns a team captain for each team, who then take turns banning three champions each, disallowing both teams from playing those six champions. Draft players then choose their champions in an ordered back-and-forth format. Because both teams can see which champion each player is picking, no player can pick a champion that has already been picked by another player.

Ranked matches are available to players that are level 50.Ranked uses a draft pick system exclusively, and players are seeded into a League system based on the outcome of their matches. Winning and losing games influences a player's MMR, which is intended to keep all players' skill levels in any given game as close as possible.

Co-op vs. AI mode matches players against a team of bots. Similar to the Tutorial mode, it is also intended mainly as a way for inexperienced players to learn.

Showdown game mode, played either 1 vs. 1 or 2 vs. 2 on the map.Each team played until one team achieved one of three goals: taking down an enemy turret, reaching 100 team minion kills, or killing 15 times the enemy player (or two in 2 vs. 2 matches).

Epic Battle game mode, played either 15 vs. 15 on the map.Each team played until one team achieved one of one goal: Taking down the enemy Base.
